Hello!

In these pages you'll find information about what I've been doing over the past few years that are relevant to my profession and volunteering work. I'm trying this out as a system to make it easy for me to send information to people and to keep my CV information updated.

- Too long, didn't read professional:

  - I have a background in Neurosciences and have been involved with Open Science initiatives for a number of years. Pushing openness in science is be the way I found to contribute to a fairer society. I do this by developing and teaching others how to build their own open scientific equipment.  


- Too long, didn't read Volunteering:
  - I've been fortunate enough that my day job enables me to contribute some of my time to initiatives that help boost science and groups scientific independency all over the globe:

    - [Trend in Africa]()
    - [GOSH community]()
    - [Mozilla Open Leaders]()
    - [Open Know How]()
