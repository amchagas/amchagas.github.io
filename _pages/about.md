## Here you will find useful info on the work I have been doing in the past decades

I am passionate about the democratization of science and education, as well as its improvement through the adoption of transparent, replicable tools and methods. I specialise in Open Science development, more specifically in Open Hardware and its implications.

As others adopting and developing open hardware, I know that making it widespread in academia will greatly benefit those using it, as well as future academic generations. We have growing evidence that open hardware and open science as a whole, not only leads to a more diverse and accessible research and education landscape, but also allows researchers and educators to create tools that are better, since they are built for purpose, with intent and respecting local realities. These tools tend to be more affordable, easier to customise, calibrate and repair, which can greatly increase research speed and its outcomes.


### I currently hold three main functions at the University of Sussex:

- Assistant Professor in Open Science
- Scientific Officer
- Lead at then [Open Research Technologies Hub](https://opensussex.org)

### I also volunteer at different projects:
- Creator of [Open Neuroscience](https://open-neuroscience.com)
- Open Science Lead at [TReND in Africa](https://trendinafrica.org)
- Co-creator of [Open Hardware Makers](https://openhardware.space)
