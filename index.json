However, combining 2P imaging with spectrally arbitrary light stimulation can be challenging due to crosstalk between stimulation light and fluorescence detection. To overcome this limitation, we present a simple and low-cost electronic solution based on an ESP32 microcontroller and a TLC5947 LED driver to rapidly time-interleave stimulation and detection epochs during scans. Implemented for less than $100, our design can independently drive up to 24 arbitrary spectrum LEDs to meet user requirements. We demonstrate the utility of our stimulator for colour vision experiments on the in vivo tetrachromatic zebrafish retina and for optogenetic circuit mapping in Drosophila.","tags":null,"title":"LED Zappelin′: An open source LED controller for arbitrary spectrum visual stimulation and optogenetics during 2-photon imaging.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhijian Zhao","David A.

Current experimental techniques for studying processing in the IPL do not allow imaging the entire IPL simultaneously in the intact tissue.

However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena, can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called ‘FlyPi’.

Depending on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under €100 and features optional modules for light-emitting diode (LED)-based fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs approximately €200 or substantially less if the user is prepared to ‘shop around’. All functions of FlyPi can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate FlyPi’s capabilities, we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate FlyPi’s utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and modular nature as well as fully open design of FlyPi make it a highly versatile tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres, and research labs.","tags":["3D printing","Zebrafish","Cameras","Fluorescence microscopy","Light-emitting diodes","Fluorescence imaging","Drosophila melanogaster","Larvae"],"title":"The €100 lab: A 3D-printable open-source platform for fluorescence microscopy, optogenetics, and accurate temperature control during behaviour of zebrafish, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andre Maia Chagas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496847600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496847600,"objectID":"8ff8da9c4e42897d215cbc4cee1b086c","permalink":"https://amchagas.github.io/talk/2017_phd_retreat_munich/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T20:05:24Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017_phd_retreat_munich/","section":"talk","summary":"Talk at the Student retreat of the [Muenich Technical University (TUM)](http://sfb924.wzw.tum.de/index.php?id=48).\n```Retreat Bernried, 07.-09.06.2017 Invited Speakers: Marcel Quint (University of Halle-Wittenberg, DE), Rüdiger Simon (University of Düsseldorf, DE), André Maia Chagas (University of Tübingen, DE) Courses: Conflict managment in academia (schainundkuchenbrandt, DE), Project managment in academia (Golin Wissenschaftsmanagment, DE) Activities: Table tennis, bowling, hiking ````\n\nOrganized by: [Alexander Kutschera](https://alexanderkutschera.com/) ","tags":[],"title":"Academic Science is Crippled: How Open Source and Open Access are bringing science back to the 21st century","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Andre Maia Chagas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1495548000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495548000,"objectID":"ff36e356f0db2c4c49601caf5132b09f","permalink":"https://amchagas.github.io/talk/2017_biohacking_medical_field/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T20:05:10Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017_biohacking_medical_field/","section":"talk","summary":"Remote talk at Higher Institute of Medical Technology (Yaounde, Cameroon) about the use of open source hardware for the medical field, as part of the event \"Biohacking in the medical Field: perspectives for developing countries\".","tags":[],"title":"The use of open source hardware in the medical field","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Andre Maia Chagas","Lucia Prieto Godino","Aristides B Arrenberg","Tom Baden"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"2dcec8d3b7f4ca1d87899d469eb160e6","permalink":"https://amchagas.github.io/publication/maia-chagas-100-2017/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T17:53:44.705116Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maia-chagas-100-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Small, genetically tractable species such as larval zebrafish, Drosophila or C. elegans have become key model organisms in modern neuroscience.

While GLMs are attractive for their computational tractability, they also impose strong assumptions and thus only allow for a limited range of stimulus-response relationships to be discovered. Alternative approaches exist that make only very weak assumptions but scale poorly to high-dimensional stimulus spaces. Here we seek an approach which can gracefully interpolate between the two extremes. We extend two frequently used special cases of the GLM—a linear and a quadratic model—by assuming that the spike-triggered and non-spike-triggered distributions can be adequately represented using Gaussian mixtures. Because we derive the model from a generative perspective, its components are easy to interpret as they correspond to, for example, the spike-triggered distribution and the interspike interval distribution. The model is able to capture complex dependencies on high-dimensional stimuli with far fewer parameters than other approaches such as histogram-based methods. The added flexibility comes at the cost of a non-concave log-likelihood. We show that in practice this does not have to be an issue and the mixture-based model is able to outperform generalized linear and quadratic models.","tags":["Neurons","Neuroscience","Cellular neuroscience","Generalized linear model","Linear filters","Probability distribution","Statistical models","Vibrissae"],"title":"Beyond GLMs: A Generative Mixture Modeling Approach to Neural System Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andre Maia Chagas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1371480027,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1371480027,"objectID":"84c11030f76bf933a02a700aea0483cd","permalink":"https://amchagas.github.io/talk/2013_sona/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T19:40:27Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2013_sona/","section":"talk","summary":"Talk at the Symposium: State of the art and affordable basic neuroscience in Africa Insects in focus","tags":["Open Science","Open Hardware"],"title":"The Power of Open Source","type":"talk"},{"authors":["André Maia Chagas","Lucas Theis","Biswa Sengupta","Maik Christopher Stüttgen","Matthias Bethge","Cornelius Schwarz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"be9142641a6db56e2cb806b579465d9b","permalink":"https://amchagas.github.io/publication/maia-chagas-functional-2013/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T17:53:44.715672Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maia-chagas-functional-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Sensory receptors determine the type and the quantity of information available for perception.

Information theoretic analysis of instantaneous spike-triggered kinematic stimulus features was used to gain functional insight on ‘what’ is coded by primary afferents. Amongst the kinematic variables tested - position, velocity, and acceleration - primary afferent spikes encoded velocity best. The other two variables contribute to information transfer, but only if combined with velocity. We further revealed three additional characteristics that play a role in information transfer by primary afferents. Firstly, primary afferent spikes show preference for well separated multiple stimuli (i.e. well separated sets of combinations of the three instantaneous kinematic variables). Secondly, spikes are sensitive to short strips of the stimulus trajectory (up to 10 ms pre-spike time), and thirdly, they show spike patterns (precise doublet and triplet spiking). In order to deal with these complexities, we used a flexible probabilistic neuron model fitting mixtures of Gaussians to the spike triggered stimulus distributions, which quantitatively captured the contribution of the mentioned features and allowed us to achieve a full functional analysis of the total information rate indicated by the direct method. We found that instantaneous position, velocity, and acceleration explained about 50% of the total information rate. Adding a 10 ms pre-spike interval of stimulus trajectory achieved 80-90%. The final 10-20% were found to be due to non-linear coding by spike bursts.","tags":["Vibrissae","Information Theory","primary afferents","rat","spike-triggered mixture model","tactile coding","whisker"],"title":"Functional analysis of ultra high information rates conveyed by rat vibrissal primary afferents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Heinrich Schell","Cindy Boden","André Maia Chagas","Philipp J.

Cognitive impairment is recapitulated in several αSYN transgenic mouse lines. However, the mechanisms of dysfunction in affected neurons are largely unknown. Here we measured neuronal activity induced gene products in the limbic system of αSYN transgenic mice upon fear conditioning (FC). Induction of the synaptic plasticity marker c-Fos was significantly reduced in the amygdala and hippocampus of (Thy1)-h[A30P]αSYN transgenic mice in an age-dependent manner. Similarly, the neuronal activity inducible polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2) that can phosphorylate αSYN at the pathological site serine-129 was up-regulated in both brain regions upon FC. Plk2 inductions were also significantly impaired in aged (Thy1)-h[A30P]αSYN transgenic mice, both in the amygdala and hippocampus. Plk2 inductions in the amygdala after FC were paralleled by a small but significant increase in the number of neuronal cell bodies immunopositive for serine-129 phosphorylated αSYN in young but not aged (Thy1)-h[A30P]αSYN transgenic mice. In addition, we observed in the aged hippocampus a distinct type of apparently unmodified transgenic αSYN profiles resembling synaptic accumulations of αSYN. Thus, the cognitive decline observed in aged αSYN transgenic mice might be due to impairment of neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the limbic system by distinct αSYN species.","tags":["Mice","Mouse models","Amygdala","Cognitive impairment","Genetically modified animals","Hippocampus","Immunostaining","Synaptic plasticity"],"title":"Impaired c-Fos and Polo-Like Kinase 2 Induction in the Limbic System of Fear-conditioned α-Synuclein Transgenic Mice","type":"publication"}]
