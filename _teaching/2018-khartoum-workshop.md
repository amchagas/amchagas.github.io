  In this workshop researchers and post graduates of the [University of Khartoum](https://www.uofk.edu/index.php/ar/) were introduced to open source ethos and practices and how they can be applied to research. More in depth they learned how to use arduinos to build lab equipment and built [FlyPis](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002702) (soldering PCBs, burning operating system images, etc) as a project based learning for building science hardware.
