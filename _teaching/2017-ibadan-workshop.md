  Open Labware workshop where researchers and post-graduate students learned hands on how to use electronics and open source tools to build and benchmark their own lab equipment. Participants also build a 3D printer from scratch, learned how to service and operate it, and once the workshop was done, they brought the printers back to their home institutions.

  This workshop was organized and conceptualized by volunteers of [Trend in Africa](www.tredninafrica.org)
