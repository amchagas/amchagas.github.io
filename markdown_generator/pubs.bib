	abstract = {Two-photon (2P) microscopy is a cornerstone technique in neuroscience research. However, combining 2P imaging with spectrally arbitrary light stimulation can be challenging due to crosstalk between stimulation light and fluorescence detection. To overcome this limitation, we present a simple and low-cost electronic solution based on an ESP32 microcontroller and a TLC5947 LED driver to rapidly time-interleave stimulation and detection epochs during scans. Implemented for less than \$100, our design can independently drive up to 24 arbitrary spectrum LEDs to meet user requirements. We demonstrate the utility of our stimulator for colour vision experiments on the in vivo tetrachromatic zebrafish retina and for optogenetic circuit mapping in Drosophila.},

	abstract = {Visual neuroscientists require accurate control of visual stimulation. However, few stimulator solutions simultaneously offer high spatio-temporal resolution and free control over the spectra of the light sources, because they rely on off-the-shelf technology developed for human trichromatic vision. Importantly, consumer displays fail to drive UV-shifted short wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors, which strongly contribute to visual behaviour in many animals, including mice, zebrafish and fruit flies. Moreover, many non-mammalian species feature more than three spectral photoreceptor types. Here, we present a flexible, spatial visual stimulator with up to 6 arbitrary spectrum chromatic channels. It combines a standard digital light processing engine with open source hard- and software that can be easily adapted to the experimentalist’s needs. We demonstrate the capability of this general visual stimulator experimentally in the in vitro mouse retinal whole-mount and the \textit{in vivo} zebrafish. Hereby, we intend starting a community effort of sharing and developing a common stimulator design.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
          
            Movement is a key feature of animal systems, yet its embryonic origins are not fully understood. Here we investigate the genetic basis underlying the embryonic onset of movement in
            Drosophila
            focusing on the role played by small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, miRNAs). To this end, we first develop a quantitative behavioural pipeline capable of tracking embryonic movement in large populations of fly embryos, and using this system, discover that the
            Drosophila
            miRNA
            miR-2b-1
            plays a role in the emergence of movement. Through the combination of spectral analysis of embryonic motor patterns, cell sorting and RNA
            in situs
            , genetic reconstitution tests, and neural optical imaging we define that
            miR-2b-1
            influences the emergence of embryonic movement by exerting actions in the developing nervous system. Furthermore, through the combination of bioinformatics coupled to genetic manipulation of miRNA expression and phenocopy tests we identify a previously uncharacterised (but evolutionarily conserved) chloride channel encoding gene – which we term
            Janus
            – as a genetic target that mechanistically links
            miR-2b-1
            to the onset of movement. Cell-specific genetic reconstitution of
            miR-2b-1
            expression in a null miRNA mutant background, followed by behavioural assays and target gene analyses, suggest that
            miR-2b-1
            affects the emergence of movement through effects in sensory elements of the embryonic circuitry, rather than in the motor domain. Our work thus reports the first miRNA system capable of regulating embryonic movement, suggesting that other miRNAs are likely to play a role in this key developmental process in
            Drosophila
            as well as in other species.},

            African science has substantial potential, yet it grapples with significant challenges.

We detail the steps taken to establish BioRTC, emphasising the critical importance of stakeholder engagement, community involvement, resource optimisation and collaborations. With its state‐of‐the‐art facilities and commitment to training African scientists, BioRTC is poised to significantly advance neuroscience research and training in the region. Although we are in the early stages of our journey, our model, emphasizing open access and inclusivity, offers a replicable blueprint for neuroscience research development in similar resource‐limited settings, promising to enrich the global neuroscience community.

	abstract = {The field of 3D bioengineering proposes to effectively contribute to the manufacture of artificial multicellular organ/tissues and the understanding of complex cellular mechanisms. In this regard, 3D cell cultures comprise a promising bioengineering possibility for the alternative treatment of organ function loss, potentially improving patient life expectancies. Patients with end-stage disease, for example, could benefit from treatment until organ transplantation or even undergo organ function restoration. Currently, 3D bioprinters can produce tissues such as trachea cartilage or artificial skin. Most low-cost 3D bioprinters are built from fused deposition modeling 3D printer frames modified for the deposition of biologically compatible material, ranging between \$13.000,00 and \$300.000,00. Furthermore, the cost of consumables should also be considered as they, can range from \$3,85 and \$100.000,00 per gram, making biomaterials expensive, hindering bioprinting access. In this context, our report describes the first prototype of a significantly low-cost 3D bioprinter built from recycled scrap metal and off-the-shelf electronics. We demonstrate the functionalized process and methodology proof of concept and aim to test it in different biological tissue scaffolds in the future, using affordable materials and open-source methodologies, thus democratizing the state of the art of this technology.},

	abstract = {Background:  Personal protective equipment (PPE) supply shortages were a big issue in the fight against COVID-19 around the world at the onset of the pandemic, requiring all communities to find innovative ways to make and supply PPE for health workers, vulnerable people and the general public. To this end and in line with the WHO’s call for 40\% raise in PPE production across the world, we sought to alleviate the PPE shortage and to support our local communities using 3D printing (additive manufacturing) and free and open-source hardware (FOSH). Methods: : Utilising a 3D printer and off-the-shelf components, reusable face shields and face masks were produced based on open source designs. Off-the-shelf components included transparent polyvinyl chloride (PVC) visor, ribbon tapings and elastic bands for the face shields, as well as cushioning pads (clothed foams) and filters (sensitive tissues) for the face masks. Hygienic measures employed during fabrication included the assembly following safety protocols, disinfection of products with ultraviolet bactericidal lamps, ensuring hygiene during collection and distribution. Users’ real-life experience and feedback were utilised to modify and improve on quality and adaptability of the designs. Results: : In a period of three months, over 400 reusable 3D-printed face shields and face masks were produced by a team of academics, for health practitioners, other professionals and people across the Olabisi Onabanjo University community and other cities within Ogun and Lagos states. Conclusions: : More awareness is generally required on the potentials of 3D printing and FOSH in the global south, particularly in universities and research institutions where innovative alternatives to expensive equipment remain vital. Our feat corroborated and advocated these potentials in a low-income setting like Nigeria, where the immediate response and synergy between academics, and researchers yielded a substantial number of PPE to front line workers, in a timely manner at the peak of the viral transmission and lockdowns- a period wherein manufacturers of PPEs struggled to establish their commercial logistics. We emphasize the need for university managements to support academics and researchers strongly to deliver on much needed community support in crises time, and encourage governmental and non-governmental bodies to consider investing in this innovative self-reliant perspective through their research funding and managemnt programmes in a bid to achieving a lot more with the less funds.

	abstract = {Sensory receptors determine the type and the quantity of information available for perception. Here, we quantified and characterized the information transferred by primary afferents in the rat whisker system using neural system identification. Quantification of ‘how much’ information is conveyed by primary afferents, using the direct method, a classical information theoretic tool, revealed that primary afferents transfer huge amounts of information (up to 529 bits/s). Information theoretic analysis of instantaneous spike-triggered kinematic stimulus features was used to gain functional insight on ‘what’ is coded by primary afferents. Amongst the kinematic variables tested - position, velocity, and acceleration - primary afferent spikes encoded velocity best. The other two variables contribute to information transfer, but only if combined with velocity. We further revealed three additional characteristics that play a role in information transfer by primary afferents. Firstly, primary afferent spikes show preference for well separated multiple stimuli (i.e. well separated sets of combinations of the three instantaneous kinematic variables). Secondly, spikes are sensitive to short strips of the stimulus trajectory (up to 10 ms pre-spike time), and thirdly, they show spike patterns (precise doublet and triplet spiking). In order to deal with these complexities, we used a flexible probabilistic neuron model fitting mixtures of Gaussians to the spike triggered stimulus distributions, which quantitatively captured the contribution of the mentioned features and allowed us to achieve a full functional analysis of the total information rate indicated by the direct method. We found that instantaneous position, velocity, and acceleration explained about 50\% of the total information rate. Adding a 10 ms pre-spike interval of stimulus trajectory achieved 80-90\%. The final 10-20\% were found to be due to non-linear coding by spike bursts.},

Cognitive impairment is recapitulated in several αSYN transgenic mouse lines. However, the mechanisms of dysfunction in affected neurons are largely unknown. Here we measured neuronal activity induced gene products in the limbic system of αSYN transgenic mice upon fear conditioning (FC). Induction of the synaptic plasticity marker c-Fos was significantly reduced in the amygdala and hippocampus of (Thy1)-h[A30P]αSYN transgenic mice in an age-dependent manner. Similarly, the neuronal activity inducible polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2) that can phosphorylate αSYN at the pathological site serine-129 was up-regulated in both brain regions upon FC. Plk2 inductions were also significantly impaired in aged (Thy1)-h[A30P]αSYN transgenic mice, both in the amygdala and hippocampus. Plk2 inductions in the amygdala after FC were paralleled by a small but significant increase in the number of neuronal cell bodies immunopositive for serine-129 phosphorylated αSYN in young but not aged (Thy1)-h[A30P]αSYN transgenic mice. In addition, we observed in the aged hippocampus a distinct type of apparently unmodified transgenic αSYN profiles resembling synaptic accumulations of αSYN. Thus, the cognitive decline observed in aged αSYN transgenic mice might be due to impairment of neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the limbic system by distinct αSYN species.},

	abstract = {Generalized linear models (GLMs) represent a popular choice for the probabilistic characterization of neural spike responses. While GLMs are attractive for their computational tractability, they also impose strong assumptions and thus only allow for a limited range of stimulus-response relationships to be discovered. Alternative approaches exist that make only very weak assumptions but scale poorly to high-dimensional stimulus spaces. Here we seek an approach which can gracefully interpolate between the two extremes. We extend two frequently used special cases of the GLM—a linear and a quadratic model—by assuming that the spike-triggered and non-spike-triggered distributions can be adequately represented using Gaussian mixtures. Because we derive the model from a generative perspective, its components are easy to interpret as they correspond to, for example, the spike-triggered distribution and the interspike interval distribution. The model is able to capture complex dependencies on high-dimensional stimuli with far fewer parameters than other approaches such as histogram-based methods. The added flexibility comes at the cost of a non-concave log-likelihood. We show that in practice this does not have to be an issue and the mixture-based model is able to outperform generalized linear and quadratic models.},

However, few stimulator solutions simultaneously offer high spatio-temporal resolution and free control over the spectra of the light sources, because they rely on off-the-shelf technology developed for human trichromatic vision. Importantly, consumer displays fail to drive UV-shifted short wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors, which strongly contribute to visual behaviour in many animals, including mice, zebrafish and fruit flies. Moreover, many non-mammalian species feature more than three spectral photoreceptor types. Here, we present a flexible, spatial visual stimulator with up to 6 arbitrary spectrum chromatic channels. It combines a standard digital light processing engine with open source hard- and software that can be easily adapted to the experimentalist's needs. We demonstrate the capability of this general visual stimulator experimentally in the in vitro mouse retinal whole-mount and the in vivo zebrafish. With this work, we intend to start a community effort of sharing and developing a common stimulator design for vision research.},
